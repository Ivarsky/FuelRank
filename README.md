# FuelRank â€“ Fuel Price Aggregator for Iceland

**FuelRank** is a backend-first project that collects and stores up-to-date fuel price data from various Icelandic fuel companies. It is designed to support a future public-facing web application with filtering and ranking capabilities.

### Notes on Costco iceland
**Costco** operates a single gas station in Iceland under a membership-only model. It is often the cheapest option in the country, but unfortunately, **they do not publish fuel prices anywhere online.** So far, they have not responded to my requests for information. I am currently **exploring alternative ways to include their data** in the system in a reliable manner.
